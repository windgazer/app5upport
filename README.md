HTML5 App Support, useful JS scripts to smoothen app creation.

No longer deepening on JSTestDriver, using testem instead! Simply make sure you have install the devDependencies from package.json. The easy way to make that happen is using `npm install`. A slightly more advanced way (still using npm mind you) is to install the dependencies globally:

    npm install -g jasmine-node testem csslint

For which you might require sudo rights!!
